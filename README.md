## Getting Started

This project is a simple app that shows a list of customers fetched from an API and all of the customers having N number of address

Right now it handles:

- fetch customers data from an API
- show the list of customers
- acess to the detail of a customer
- edit customer information (even though it does not let you do the actual edit)

Also:

- it was done trying to fulfill the SOLID principles and Clean Code
- it has a structured file organization
